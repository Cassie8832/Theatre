Code Summary For Theatre

I participated in two weeks worth of sprints with a team working on customization and usabilty of a website for a movie theatre. We worked with Visual Studio, worked on front-end and back-end, and Azure. Daily stand-ups, and emails, reflected the work environment during the sprint, with code retrospectives and devOps.
One of my first assignments was to create and style a contact page where user could Contact, Donate, and give feedback.
I was also tasked with creating a photographer application user for the Blog Photo Area. The Blog Photographer acted as an admin in the Blog Photo area. 
I helped with the uploading and storage of photos by the user. I helped to make a a controller with a parameter to convert an uploaded photo into a byte[]. Then save that byte array to a table in a database. The byte[] representing each photo could also be retrieved from the database and displayed back on the View page.
All though, I was not granted permisson to upload the project to Github myself, I was granted permission to take snippets of code that I had written in order to document my work.
Joing the team for this two week sprint was amazing. Not only did I gain expierence with MVC and CRUD, I also benefited from practice of using proper version control, creating new branches from the master, and learning how to save changes. I got experience commiting and pushing branches and creating pull requests when merging branches.
Lastly, I gained knowledge on how to use Azure DevOps to maintain work items and boards. Improved on how to work as a team on a project using resources together to solve problems. For example the Slack app for communication, and also the daily Stand ups and code retrospectives with the project manager.
